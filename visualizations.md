On this page, you'll find sample visualizations that relate to the Viral Texts project. Most of these have been created for particular [project publications](https://viraltexts.org/publications/).

The newspapers published each year in the United States during the nineteenth century, derived from the Library of Congress' [US Newspaper Directory](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/titles/) and prepared as part of our forthcoming book, [_Going the Rounds_](https://manifold.umn.edu/projects/going-the-rounds). You can also open this graph [in its own window](https://viraltexts.org/img/ExtantNewspapersByYear.html). 


## Network Graphs

This graph, prepared as part of a [book chapter in progress](https://manifold.umn.edu/projects/going-the-rounds), uses the concept of "information cascades" to visualize how information circulated geographically through the US in the nineteenth century. 

Network graphs created for our article, ["Reprinting, Circulation, and the Network Author in Antebellum Newspapers."](https://ryancordell.org/research/reprinting-circulation-and-the-network-author-in-antebellum-newspapers/) can also be found [in these directories](http://networks.viraltexts.org/).


## Genre Classification

This graph shows the probabilities of newspaper texts belonging to four genres, as described in our book chapter, ["Classifying Vignettes, Modeling Hybridity."](https://manifold.umn.edu/read/untitled-bd3eb0af-fdad-4dd6-9c94-3fd15d522ab6/section/06899e82-8f06-43d2-9fc9-ea04dffef886)
