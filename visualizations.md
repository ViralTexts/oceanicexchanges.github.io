<!-- On this page, you'll find some visualizations that relate to the Viral Texts project. There are many <a href="http://networks.viraltexts.org/">network graphs available at a separate URL</a>.

One of the ways we have recently been looking at the Viral Texts data is through the paratext printed along with the shared texts. The paratext of one text we've investigated had a particularly striking transformation as it traveled through time and space: its author changed from the New York lawyer, editor, and diplomat Charles Monroe Dickinson to the famed author Charles Dickens. This time-lapse visualization shows the locations in which the text was attributed to Dickinson versusÂ those where it was attributed to Dickens.
